## Credits  
The **"Lake Ontario, Oneida, Onondaga Program (LOOOP)"** was developed by the [Upstate Freshwater Institute (UFI)](www.upstatefreshwater.org), a not-for-profit corporation dedicated to advancing freshwater science and education in New York. 

This web application and the LOOOP was made possible by funding through the **New York's Great Lakes Basin Small Grants Program** (made possible by the New York State Environmental Protection Fund and Article 14 of Environmental Conservation Law; 2021) and by the **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Bay Watershed Education and Training (B-WET) program** for the Great Lakes region (2022). _Additional support for the LOOOP loan program has been provided by the Youth Learning As Citizen Scientists (YLACES) and Dreyfus Foundation._
  
Webpage content was developed by UFI staff and volunteers and workstudy students from the New York State College of Environmental Science and Forestry.  

This application was made using Rstudio, R, and the shinyapps.io server platforms. The application code is freely available in a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/mamatt-17/LOOOP).
