# Physical and Chemical Parameter Descriptions and Their Importance to Water Quality

The study of aquatic resources focuses on properties of water that are important to the overall health of a lake, pond, or stream. The foundation of life as we know it exists because of the unique properties of water that allow organisms to utilize it, and the environment that it creates. For example, because the density of solid water (ice) is lower than liquid water, ice floats, allowing biological processes to continue even when the surface of a waterbody freezes. Globally, water mediates the climate due to it's high specific heat (simply put specific heat is the amount of energy required to warm or cool down 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius). If you have ever traveled to the coast of an ocean or a large inland lake such as one of the Laurentian Great Lakes, you have experienced the effects of this property of water as the air temperature cools the nearer you travel to water. On this page are descriptions of water quality parameters commonly collected as part of water quality monitoring for research and management purposes. This is by no means an all inclusive list since the collection of different types of data is focused depending on the goals of specific programs. 

When reading through these descriptions try to consider the effect that one parameter might have on others. For example, with increasing depth the temperature of water changes, with different magnitudes depending on season as well as physical characteristics of a body of water such as depth, surface area, and flow to name a few. 

## Temperature

Water temperature is one of the most critical factors driving the overall characteristics of a waterbody. Water density changes with water temperature, creating a unique phenomenon where cold, dense water underlies warmer upper layers during periods of high air temperature; this is known as "thermal stratification". Those who live in temperate regions are likely familiar with this if they have swam in a stratified body of water and dove down to the "thermocline" which is where the warm upper layer and cool bottom layer meet and temperature changes rapidly. When the air drops below freezing ice is formed at the surface because the density of ice is less than water. Perhaps more remarkably, under the ice water that is four degrees Celsius is actually the most dense as a result of chemical properties of water molecules. This unique trait results in a characteristic known as "reverse thermal stratification" where the warmest water (4Â°C) is on the bottom!!! Thermal stratification regimes are important for many species of biota including cold water fishes which are restricted to water temperatures below a threshold, but also by the presence of sufficient dissolved oxygen in the water. The amount of oxygen that can be dissolved in water is impacted by temperature as well, with cool water able to hold more than warm water (see Dissolved Oxygen description below). 

## pH (Potential of Hydrogen)

Most people have been exposed to the idea of pH through the concept of acidity and may recognize that a low pH means that a solution is acidic. They may even know that a pH of 7.0 means that a solution is "neutral" and a pH greater than 7.0 is considered "basic". But what are these values relative to? The answer may seem somewhat complicated: pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in solution. Remember that water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom ( H2O). Water molecules can actually break apart into two parts (a free hydrogen H, and what is known as a hydroxide group (OH)), and when the pH is neutral the concentration of each of these is the same. Only in situations where a compound which increases the free hydrogen (aka an acid) or a compound which increases the hydroxide concentration (aka a base) is introduced does the pH of water change. This property of water plays an important role in waters ability to hold other important compounds in solution, as well as in biological functioning critical to sustain life including respiration across gill membranes. A lower pH allows more compounds to be in solution, and also affects the bio-availability of dissolved compounds (the ability for a compound to be taken in by an organism). While understanding pH, how it is measured, what different values mean, and what impacts it in the environment can be difficult at first, a good starting point for understanding is that typical pH values in surface water (lakes, ponds, and rivers) ranges from about 6.0 - 8.0, and it is normal to observe moderate variability in pH levels during a single sample at various depths and or locations due to chemical, physical, and biological processes happening in the water. Very low (less than 5.0) or very high (above 9.0) pH reading are indicative of water quality impairment.

## Specific Conductance

We all know that you shouldn't go swimming during an electrical storm because water conducts electricity. However, what most people don't realize is that measuring how well water conducts an electrical current can be a useful parameter for scientists and managers. Differences in specific conductance of water is caused by variability in the amount of dissolved ions in solution; if there are more "things" dissolved in water there are more pathways for electricity to travel and conductance increases. You might think of specific conductance as a measure of the "saltiness" of water (since salts are ions they increase conductivity), however specific conductance is increased by any dissolved ions. High specific conductance indicates large amounts of dissolved ions and is useful for tracking pollution. The units used to report it are Siemens, and typically water falls in the lower ranges so you will likely see either Millisiemens or Microsiemens per centimeter.

## Dissolved Oxygen

Just as for terrestrial life, biological life in water requires oxygen to survive (barring some sulfate based life in the deep oceans near volcanic vents). Like all other compounds, oxygen must be dissolved in water and therefore competes for "space" with other dissolved compounds (if there are a lot of other dissolved compounds, less oxygen can be dissolved). Additionally, it is impacted by temperature (higher temperature water is capable of holding less dissolved oxygen than colder temperature water), biological respiration (uptake), decomposition (uptake), and photosynthesis (output). The amount of dissolved oxygen that water holds is one of the most important parameters of water quality. We typically think of oxygen as critical to respiration, and this is true in water where insufficient levels can result of aquatic organism die-offs. However, dissolved oxygen is also important for chemical processes in water that impact overall water quality. Many compounds are tightly bound and unavailable for organisms to use in the presence of oxygen, including limiting nutrients for photosynthesis and toxic heavy metals, but are liberated and "bio-available" when oxygen becomes depleted. In stratified bodies of water (cool water below, warm water at the surface), the lack of mixing of the cool layer that lies at the bottom accompanied by respiration and decompositional processes (utilizing oxygen), often results in dissolved oxygen depletion in the cold, deep zones. When this layer mixed upward as the upper water cools during fall, these liberated compounds can be distributed upward and cause water quality problems. 

## Turbidity

Turbidity measures the relative clarity of water which is impacted by both biological (algae) and inorganic (sediment) materials suspended in the water column. Measurements of turbidity can pick up on both large algal populations (blooms) as well as erosion induced sediment loading, or sediment re-suspension caused by turbulence from wave action or subsurface currents. High turbidity is associated with poor water quality. Turbidity is reported in "Nephelometric Turbidity Units" or NTU where 1 milligram of suspended material in one liter of water is equal to 3.0 NTU. 

## Chlorophyll-*a*

Chlorophyll is the photosynthetic pigment utilized by primary producers to produce organic compounds from simple molecules, releasing oxygen as a by-product which supports life on Earth as we know it. Therefore, we can measure the amount of chlorophyll in water as a proxy for the amount of photosynthesis occurring, which gives us an idea about the density of primary producers (algae) in a water sample. While some primary production is necessary to support the base of the food web, an excess of algal growth is often the result of nutrient pollution and an indicator of poor water quality. Monitoring chloropyll levels over time can indicate regime shifts caused by human induced changes to a waterbody and or the surrounding watershed. For a detailed explanation of chlorophyll measurements in water follow this link: [The Basics of Chlorophyll Measurement in Surface Water -Pat Higgins]("https://www.ysi.com/ysi-blog/water-blogged-blog/2014/06/the-basics-of-chlorophyll-measurement-in-surface-water")

## Orthophosphate

In the 1970's in Canada's Experimental Lakes Area, it was demonstrated that phosphorus was limiting in most freshwater aquatic ecosystems through a series of whole lake experiments ([Clean Lakes Alliance - Phosphorus]("https://www.cleanlakesalliance.org/phosphorus/")). Since then researchers and managers alike have focused on reducing phosphorus inputs to freshwater systems with the goal of minimizing human induced increases in primary productivity (algal blooms). Orthophosphate is a form of phosphorus that is readily available and usable to primary producers, and therefore is directly related to the capacity of a waterbody to support algal populations.
