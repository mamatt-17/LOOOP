# Using the Data Explorer  
 

## Using the Map
You can zoom in and out on the map by either selecting the plus(+)/minus(-) buttons in the top left-hand corner or scrolling with your mouse while the cursor is hovering over the map. You can move the map by clicking on the map and dragging the cursor.  

Circles on this map indicate monitoring locations of <span style="color:blue">streams</span> and <span style="color:red">weather</span> with data collected by student groups and local youth! If you click on a circle, the site name, latest data collection date, and the group that collected the data will appear in a pop-up box. _Note_, monitoring at these sites was not year-round and not all parameters were monitored at each site. To exit out of the pop-up window, you can select the X in the top right-hand corner or click the map or another sampling site.  

## Plot Data
Using the "Plot Options" box, you can create graphs showing measurements of water quality or weather over time. Use the dropdown box to first select to view either **Stream** or **Weather** datasets. After selecting your dataset, select a **Site**. Note that if you are looking at <span style="color:blue">stream data</span>, then you will be graphing the data of all monitoring locations along that stream and there may be more than one monitoring location along the length of the stream. Next, select your desired **Parameter**, or environmental measurement. The selected parameter will populate your graph (y-axis). Once you have made these selections, the **Date Range** will appear in the Plot Options box with the earliest monitoring date listed on the left and the most recent monitoring date listed on the right. You can move both ends of this sliding scale to change the timeframe (x-axis) shown on the graph. 

There may be limited data collected at any particular site. If your selections do not produce any points on the graph, there is no data available for the criteria you have set.Make adjustments to the drop-down choices to reset the graph.  

## Interactive Plot/Data Table Generation
After selecting the parameters and creating a plot, you will be able to interact directly with the data on the plot to generate a data table! Select points of interest on your plot by clicking and dragging your mouse to form a rectangular selection. Additional information about the data that are in your selected area will appear in the table underneath the plot.


# About the Data

## Why were these data collected?
These data were collected by students as part of the [Upstate Freshwater Institute's (UFI)](www.upstatefreshwater.org) _**"Lake Ontario, Oneida, Onondaga Program (LOOOP)"**_. As part of this program, student groups can borrow supplies and equipment to monitor weather, stream water quality, stream macroinvertebrate communities, and streamflow in our local watersheds. The _**"Lake Ontario, Oneida, Onondaga Program (LOOOP)"**_ aims to provide high school teachers with the knowledge and resources to facilitate student-led investigations and discussions about environmental issues and stewardship relevant to the Great Lakes Basin

## What kind of equipment or supplies do I need to collect environmental data?
Currently our app is able to show data that is collected in streams using Izaak Walton League or GLOBE protocols. Our equipment loan program offers water chemistry testing kits, nets, and measuring tools that are needed to make these observations. Learn more about the stream parameters by clicking on the navigation tab! Our app also shows hourly data of weather parameters collected using a Onset HOBOÂ® weather station. Each weather station is outfitted with the same sensors and students may choose at what frequency to collect data. Learn more about the weather parameters by clicking on the navigation tab!

## How can I submit data to this app?
Data can be submitted to UFI by filling out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/rVUDd8ZK3bgaAaQL6). Weather data is collected by an electronic weather station and is uploaded to the app as soon as the equipment is returned to UFI or emailed to UFI staff.

## Where can I learn more about our local waterways?
